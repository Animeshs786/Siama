later: vendor wallet

Note:
if user deleted his saved address, we remove it from his array but not from address Schema
because it's id is being used in somewhere else i.e. booking
its solution is to only make schema not models but in create booking api jatin sir wants to
give only id of the saved address
i can also make changes according to that, i can get the user and get his saved address by id
then extract and save all the Details of address in booking

TODO: booking created with offer : not paid : offer expire : paid later will get the discount
